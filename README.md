# Summer Training Project: Fantasy Cricket Game Development with Python

# Project Overview
This repository contains the documentation and code for a 6-week summer training project focused on developing a fantasy cricket game using Python. The project is designed to introduce Python programming and includes comprehensive training on Python basics, object-oriented programming (OOP), databases, and GUI development.

# Training Content

Introduction to Python: Fundamentals and syntax

Python Basics: Data types, control structures, functions, and modules

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism

Databases: SQL, database design, interaction with Python

GUI Development: Building interfaces with Python libraries

# Project Goals
The main objective is to create a fully functional fantasy cricket game. This involves:

Problem Definition: Understanding the requirements and rules of the fantasy game
Database Design: Structuring the data for player stats, teams, and game logic
Game Interface: Designing and developing the user interface for the game
Coding: Implementing the game logic, database interactions, and GUI
Testing: Ensuring the game runs smoothly and is bug-free

# Project Highlights
Database Design: Detailed schema for storing player data, teams, and match information
User Interface: Screenshots of the game interface, showcasing the GUI design
Code Implementation: Step-by-step development of the game's functionality
Testing and Debugging: Methods used to test and refine the game

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using Python for teaching programming concepts through practical application. The fantasy cricket game serves as an engaging way to learn and apply Python skills in a real-world scenario.
